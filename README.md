# Code Overview
This code is a script that imports JSON data from a Telegram chat, performs data analysis on the messages, and exports the results to an Excel file. The script uses the Python programming language and several libraries, including Pandas, Xlsxwriter, and tqdm.

# Requirements
In order to run this code, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. You will also need to install the required libraries by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

# How to Use
1. Copy the JSON file into the folder named 'data' and rename it `result.json`
2. Open the terminal in the script folder and type `python main.py`
4. Follow the prompts in the terminal or command prompt to complete the analysis.

# Code Explanation
The main function of the code is `main()`. It starts by loading the JSON data from the file and storing it in a variable called `chat_data`. Then, it calls several functions to perform different tasks, such as data analysis, exporting to Excel, filtering, and partioning.

The `convert_json_to_excel()` function takes the messages data and exports it to an Excel file. It allows you to choose the time interval for the data analysis, and it also provides an option to perform Fourier analysis.

The `filter_messages()` function filters the messages based on a keyword.

The `partition_messages()` function partitions the messages into separate groups based on specific criteria.

The `fourier_analysis()` function performs Fourier analysis on the data and creates a graph of the results.

The `get_unique_titles()`, `get_authors_count()`, `get_unique_micronations()`, and `get_unique_locations()` functions are used to extract information from the messages and display it in the terminal.

# Limitations
This code is a basic example of how to perform data analysis on Telegram chat data. It is provided as-is and is not intended to be used for production purposes. Some limitations of this code include:

- It assumes that the JSON file follows the standard Telegram format.
- It does not handle all possible message formats, such as media messages.
- It does not provide any security features, such as encryption or authentication.
